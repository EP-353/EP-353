# EP-353: Audio Programming in C

This repository hosts sample codes used in [EP-353: Audio Programming in C](https://college.berklee.edu/courses/ep-353), a class on digital signal processing and sound synthesis using the C programming language. EP-353 is a course at [Berklee College of Music](https://www.berklee.edu/) in the [Electronic Production and Design](https://college.berklee.edu/electronic-production-design) department, taught by [Akito van Troyer](https://vantroyer.com/). Sample codes are provided as a resource for learning audio programming in C. 

The repository is organized following the week-by-week schedule for the course. The first half demonstrates the basic C concepts and syntax knowledge. The second half focuses on audio programming both in non-real-time and real-time contexts. 

## Dependencies
Some programs in this repository require the following libraries:

- [libsndfile](https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile)
- [portaudio](https://github.com/PortAudio/portaudio)

Follow the tutorial on [Getting started with the Projucer](https://docs.juce.com/master/tutorial_new_projucer_project.html) to run the sample code in `14.JUCE`.
