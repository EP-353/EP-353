### Install IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
We now know how to compile and run a program. We also need an editor that can read and write our c codes, much like what we do when we use a word processing app. In this class, we will primarily use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Students are welcome to use other IDEs. Install Visual Studio Code from [this URL](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

Once the IDE is downloaded and installed, run the app. This will open Visual Studio Code and display all the files. Click on the `Extension` icon on the left side of the IDE. Then search for `C`. This should bring up C/C++ extension called `C/C++ IntelliSense, debugging, and code browsing`. Install the extension to enable C/C++ specific service within Visual Studio Code.

Let's explore the IDE a bit more and look at the `HelloWorld.c` file. How does our first compiled C program look like?
